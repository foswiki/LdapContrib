This package offers basic LDAP services for Foswiki and offers authentication of
wiki users by binding to an LDAP server as well as incorporate LDAP user
groups into access control. 

Optionally, if you need an interface to query your LDAP directory and display
the results in a topic install the <nop>LdapNgPlugin
which will make use of the <nop>LdapContrib services. 
This work is a rewrite of the <nop>LdapPlugin by
Gerard Hickey while bringing authentication, user management and
other LDAP applications onto a common base.

This package downloads all relevant records from your LDAP server into a local cache the first
time you use it. This can take a noticeable period of time depending on the size of your LDAP database.
This cache will be refreshed on a configurable interval (defaults to once a day).
You can also disable automatic refreshing and refresh the <nop>LdapContrib's cache manually using
the "Refresh Cache" button below. Read the documentation of =MaxCacheAge= in the section
"Performance Settings" in <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%">configure</a>.

---++ LDAP questionnaire
Before you can further configure the LDAP connection you will have to answer
a set of basic questions about your LDAP server. These are:

   1 What's the host name (or IP address) of the LDAP server (e.g. ldap.my.domain.com)?
   1 What port does it listen to LDAP requests (e.g. 389)?
   1 Does your LDAP Server use SASL to authenticate connections? If so which 
     authentication mechanism does it use (EXTERNAL, DIGEST-MD5, ...)?
   1 Do you have a kind of "proxy" user that the wiki can use to perform the initial connection?
     You need its DN and credentials. Advice: don't use the LDAP admin account, you
     only need a simple user that has read access to all of the directory (or the relevant
     parts); it does not need any write access.
   1 What is the "base dn" of the directory (e.g. =dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com= )?
   1 What is the common root/branch for all users? For example, Are they all found
     under =ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com= or are they are
     scattered all over the place?
   1 What is the common root/branch where all groups are defined
     (e.g. ou=group,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com)?
   1 What object class do user records have (e.g. =objectClass=organizationalPerson= )?
   1 What object class do group records have (e.g. =objectClass=group= )?
   1 Which attribute of a user record should be used to log in (must be unique)?
   1 Which attribute(s) of a user record do you want to use to construct a <nop>WikiName
     (used to display them online, pointing to their homepage)?
   1 What's the name attribute of a group?
   1 Which attribute in a group record defines its members (e.g. member or memberUid)?
     Note, that if the member attribute of a group is a DN you need to enable
     "member indirection" (see [[#Membership]]).

Collect the answers to these questions either yourself using your favorite LDAP
browser, or ask your friendly LDAP admin. 

---++ Authentication
To authenticate wiki users using your LDAP server 
you have to register the <nop>LdapPasswdUser class as the so called
<nop>PasswordManager.  This is done by adding the following lines in the
=lib/LocalSite.cfg= configuration file (or by using the =configure= tool alternatively):

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{PasswordManager} = 'Foswiki::Users::LdapPasswdUser';</verbatim>

There is a further option to fallback to the normal authentication mechanism
by defining a secondary password manager. This allows you to create native wiki
accounts, e.g. a <nop>WikiAdmin account and authenticate him without LDAP.
Use the following setting to fallback to a htpasswd based authentication.

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{SecondaryPasswordManager} = 'Foswiki::Users::HtPasswdUser';</verbatim>

So whenever authentication against LDAP fails, this second password manager will
be used. 

---++ User Groups
LDAP group records can be used in access control lists by registering a
<nop>UserMappingManager implementation. This is done by adding the following 
to your =lib/LocalSite.cfg= configuration file (or by using the =configure= tool alternatively):

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{UserMappingManager} = 'Foswiki::Users::LdapUserMapping';</verbatim>

In addition you can decide if you want to _add_ the LDAP groups or use
LDAP groups solely. This is controlled by the <nop>WikiGroupsBackoff flag.  If
switched on then LDAP groups will be added. If there's a name clash LDAP groups
take precedence. If switched off <nop>WikiGroups are ignored.

You might decide in not using your LDAP groups but still map login names
to <nop>WikiNames. Both, LDAP user groups _and_ name mapping is done by the
<nop>UserMappingManager. So to make use of name mapping but _not_ its group
feature,
register the
<nop>LdapUserMapping implementation for the <nop>UserMappingManager but
disable the <nop>MapGroups setting.

When multiple groups in your LDAP directory clash on the same group name
you might actually wish to merge these groups as used online in your wiki.
This is done using the =MergeGroups= flag. When disabled, clashing groups
are reported as a warning in the server log files when the LDAP cache is
refreshed.

---++ Membership
LDAP servers follow different schemata to define "membership". They store the
information either using a set of unique ids in
the group object (posixGroup) or the full DNs of the user objects
(groupOfNames). In the latter case the user objects' unique ids have to be
fetched separately based on their distinguished name. This mode has to be switched on 
using the =MemberIndirection= setting. 

The reverse relation, where the _user objects_ hold membership information
(for example using a =memberOf= attribute) is
maintained by some LDAP servers automatically. Those that encode membership this
way _only_ are not supported by the <nop>LdapContrib yet.

Furthermore, user objects may have one _primary_ group attribute.
This is a simple value that stores the id of a default group
that user is member of. This attribute is defined by specifying the =PrimaryGroupAttribute=
setting a.

<nop>LdapContrib reads membership information as they are stored
in the group objects, and may map the member object indirectly to the
login name. In addition any "primary group" setting stored in the user objects
is consulted as well.


---++ Normalization of login, wiki and group names
<nop>LdapContrib reads three kinds of names from your LDAP server and reuses this information
as needed. These are the login names - used to log in -,
the <nop>WikiNames - used to display users online -, and the group names - used in
access control lists.

The <nop>WikiName can be generated by 
setting the parameters 

   * =WikiNameAttributes=: a comma sedparated list of LDAP attributes taht are then
     assembled to form a proper <nop>WikiName
   * =NormalizeWikiName=: boolean flag; if  set 
      a couple of extra operations are performed to generate a proper <nop>WikiName, i.e.
      removing illegal characters.
   * =WikiNameAliases=: a comma separated key=value list of <nop>WikiNames to be mapped
     to another <nop>WikiName (DEPCRETATED: use =RewriteWikiNames= instead).
   * =RewriteWikiNames=: a list of rewrite rules; see below

Given the setting

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAttributes} = 'givenName,sn';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeWikiNames} = 1;
</verbatim>

The =givenName= and =sn= (surname) LDAP attributes will be fetched and concatenated
to form a proper <nop>WikiName, so that "givenName=Hans-Peter,sn=Schwarze" will
result in the <nop>WikiName "<nop>HansPeterSchwarze".

The login name can be normalized by enabling the

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeLoginNames} = 1;</verbatim>

setting. This will also strip off any '<nop>@...' string from the login as found
when logging ing using the mail attribute or when using !LdapContrib in combination
with a kerberos single sign on strategy.

Similar to the <nop>WikiName of a user, group names can be normalized using

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeGroupNames} = 1;</verbatim>

If a user in your LDAP directory changed his name, e.g. because of a marriage,
this use can be mapped to his/her old account using an alias that points back
from the old !WikiName to the new one. This is done using a setting like this:

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAliases} = 'MaryMalone=MaryForrester, ...'</verbatim>

The parameter takes a comma separated list of =FromWikiName=ToWikiName=. Whenever
this account is still used in an access control list, its rights will be
inherited by the targeted =ToWikiName= account.

Group names can be rewritten using a set of rewrite rules. This is useful when the
names as stored in your LDAP directory don't satisfy your criteria for being displayed
online. In conjunction with the <nop>MergeGroups flag, separate LDAP groups can be
merged onto one group as it is used online in your wiki.

A group rewrite rule is specified using

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{RewriteGroups} = {
  'pattern1' => 'substitution1',
  'pattern2' => 'substitution2',
  ...
};
</verbatim>

Each rule consists of a pattern that will be substituted in the group name as specified.
The substitute can contain variables =$1=, =$2=, ... , =$5= to insert the first, second, ..., fifth
bracket pair in the key pattern. (see perl manual for regular expressions).

Example: 

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{RewriteGroups} = {
  '(.*)_users' => '$1'
};
</verbatim>

!WikiNames can be processed similarly using the =$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{RewriteWikiNames}= 
parameter. Given the !WikiName is derived from the mail attribute, then use the following 
rule to strip off domain parts from the wiki name:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{RewriteWikiNames} = {
  '^(.*)@.*$' => '$1'
};
</verbatim>

This can be further refined to prevent name clashes by adding back the domain part:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{RewriteWikiNames} = {
  '^(.*)@(.*?)\..*\..*$' => '$1_$2'
};
</verbatim>

So given your company uses email addresses like <nop>john.doe@germany.mycompany.com
and <nop>john.doe@spain.mycompany.com it will generate the wiki names <nop>JohnDoeGermany
and <nop>JohnDoeSpain from it (given <nop>NormalizeWikiNames is switched on too).

Another trick is to add additional LDAP attributes to the =WikiNameAttributes= that
help to create unique <nop>WikiNames, and then strip off unwanted parts again
with an appropriate rewrite rule.

Example:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAttributes} = 'givenName, sn, sAMAccountName';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{RewriteWikiNames} = {
  '^(.*) [^ ]+?\-adm$' => '$1 Admin',
  '^(.*) (?!\-adm$)[^ ]+?$' => '$1',
}
</verbatim>

This might look wild at first but does the following:

   * generate a temporary <nop>WikiName concatenating the attributes according to the =WikiNameAttributes= setting,
     e.g. "John-Doe Smith jds", where jds is the sAMAccountName value 
   * let's say there's also a second record for John-Doe Smith that he uses to log in
   * with admin rights using his =jds-adm= login.
   * rule 1 of the =RewriteWikiNames= will match the =jds-adm= and will generate a nice John-Doe Smith Admin,
     whereas
   * rule 2 will only match those records that don't have the =-adm= suffic at their sAMAccountName.
   * note that both rules only copy over the first part of the string captured in brackets (.*) over to the result
     leaving out the trailing sAMAccountName part.
   * finally the string is wikified to make it a proper <nop>CamelCase word by all non-alphabetic
     characters between the parts of the name

---++ <nop>WikiName clashes

Depending on the choice of =WikiNameAttributes= and =RewriteWikiNames= rules your LDAP records will be mapped
onto a proper <nop>WikiName. These have to be unique to represent the identity of the person granted access to Foswiki. 
However, while you LDAP records are unique
due to their Distinguished Names, it is quite common that two independent records result in the
same <nop>WikiName. That's a so called name clash. You are strongly encouraged to control the way
<nop>WikiNames are generated to keep the number of name clashes as low as possible. Use appropriate
rewrite rues as described above.

In real world you will most probalby run into a name clash that you can't possibly resolve. In that case
!LdapContrib will _enumerate_ all !JohnSmiths as they are found, calling them !JohnSmith, !JohnSmith1, !JohnSmith2, etc.
Each of these maps back to a unique Distinguished Name in your LDAP directory of course.

!LdapContrib tries to keep the choice which of the !JohnSmiths maps to which DN stable over time. Whenever
you refresh the LDAP cache the previous <nop>WikiNames will be reused while new LDAP records will get a
higher number attached to the <nop>WikiName.

When !LdapContrib is building up its cache for the first time, the actual mapping is pretty arbitrary, given
there are no additional means to distinguish the names. From there on !WikiNames are kept, 
_even when you reconfigure !LdapContrib itself_. This is the default behavior not to risk mapping a different
identity to a <nop>WikiName.

You still might decide to nuke the decisions once made while resolving name clashes by refreshing the ldap
cache using the =refreshldap=force= url parameter (compared to =refreshldap=on= to up the cache regularly).

%X% Note doing this later in the life time of your wiki might accidentally swap the mapping of LDAP records
to <nop>WikiNames in case they clash. So be very cautious when doing that.


---++ SSO and <nop>LdapContrib
First of all, <nop>LdapContrib does not provide any SSO solution. Nor does LDAP
per se. However, LDAP directories might come with SSO facilities that they
provide via kerberos or similar. Unfortunately, nowadays browsers themselves are
not kerberized.  They depend on talking to the webserver using HTTP means,
which then decides which tickets are valid for the remote user by talking to
the actual authority.  That is, authentication is implemented using an
appropriate apache module.

<nop>LdapContrib can then be used to complete an LDAP integration by
providing the mapping to <nop>WikiNames as well as email information and group
definitions drawn from the LDAP directory directly.

The remaining problem is that, when a new user has been added to your LDAP
directory recently, and he/she then dashes off to sign on to the wiki right away,
<nop>LdapContrib's cache most probably is outdated. This situation is different
from one where users were authenticated by the build-in <nop>TemplateLogin
mechanism. The user would then not be able to login until the cache has been
refreshed manually or automatically.

So when the new user is authenticated using SSO and then hits the wiki, it might
fail to compute the proper <nop>WikiName. The solution to this problem is to
use the <nop>LdapApacheLogin login manager as a drop in replacement to the
standard <nop>ApacheLogin that would have been used in this situation. The
<nop>LdapApacheLogin will then take care that the remote user is known to the
cache and add this single record if it is missing.

Bottomline: whenever you are using apache to authenticate, do use the
<nop>LdapApacheLogin manager. Or in other words, whenever you configured the wiki
to use the standard <nop>ApacheLogin manager, and you now install
<nop>LdapContrib, change it to <nop>LdapApacheLogin to assure
<nop>LdapContrib's cache is up to date.


---++ Simple Example 
For the sake of this documentation we assume that users accounts in your
database are at least of the type =posixAccount= and optionally also of type
=inetOrgPerson= storing email addresses. Moreover users are stored in a subtree
=ou=people= and groups are defined in =ou=group=. Here are some example LDAP
records:

<verbatim>
dn: uid=testuser1,ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
cn: Test User1
uid: testuser1
uidNumber: 1024
gidNumber: 100
homeDirectory: /home/testuser1
loginShell: /bin/bash
mail: testuser1@my.domain.com

dn: uid=testuser2,ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
cn: Test User2
uid: testuser2
uidNumber: 1024
gidNumber: 100
homeDirectory: /home/testuser2
loginShell: /bin/bash
mail: testuser2@my.domain.com
mail: testuser2@gmx.com

# users, Group, nats.informatik.uni-hamburg.de
dn: cn=users,ou=group,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com
objectClass: posixGroup
cn: users
gidNumber: 100
memberUid: testuser1
memberUid: testuser2
</verbatim>

Please have a look at your LDAP manual on how to set up an LDAP server
and populate it with user account records. Have a look at the 
[[http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/quickstart.html][Quick-Start Guide]] on
how to install [[http://www.openldap.org/][OpenLdap]].

Use the following settings for the above example:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{Host} = 'ldap.my.domain.com';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{Port} = 389; 
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{UserBase} = 'ou=people,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com'; 
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{LoginFilter} = 'objectClass=posixAccount';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{LoginAttribute} = 'uid';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{WikiNameAttributes} = 'cn';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{NormalizeWikiNames} = 1; 
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{GroupBase} = 'ou=group,dc=my,dc=domain,dc=com';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{GroupFilter} = 'objectClass=posixGroup';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{GroupAttribute} = 'cn';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{MemberAttribute} = 'memberUid';
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{MemberIndirection} = 0;
$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{MapGroups} = 1;
</verbatim>

---++ Configuration
The <nop>LdapContrib package is configured using a set of variables that need
to be added to the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= configuration file. 
Use the <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%">configure</a> tool (at least 
once) after you installed this package. Have a look at your =lib/LocalSite.cfg=
file afterwards. You might also make your changes therein directly to
accommodate your installation to your specific LDAP installation and user
accounting. See the documentation within the =configure= tool for an explanation
of the various options.

---++ Updating the LDAP cache using a cronjob
In some environments, updating the internal LDAP cache of the <nop>LdapContrib might
take considerable time. The intervals the cache data is thought to be "expired" is
configured using the =MaxCacheAge= setting. This setting defaults to updating the
cache every 24 hours. The refresh procedure will then be triggered by the first request
that hits the site when this period expired. 

To remove this burden from the "first visitor in the morning", the automatic refresh procedure can
be disabled by setting 

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{Ldap}{MaxCacheAge} = 0; </verbatim>

This means that the age of the cached data will not be checked _automatically_ anymore. The 
responsibility that the data is updated is now up to you, that is you have to update the 
cache _explicitly_. This can be done by either hitting the red "Refresh Cache" button above,
or by setting up an appropriate cronjob on the machine running your wiki server.

To trigger an explicit update of the cache on 5 past midnight every day use a
cronjob similar to:

<verbatim>
5 0 * * * cd <wiki-install-path>/bin && ./view refreshldap=on Main/WebHome >/dev/null
</verbatim>

This will call the engine on the command line and provide the necessary query parameters so
that the <nop>LdapContrib will force an update of the cache data.

---++ Debugging !LDAP 

Very often either the directory structure of your LDAP server is rather complicated or the
settings of !LdapContrib are not as intuitive or easy to comprehend. For this reason
the first best thing to do is to enable ={Ldap}{Debug}= in <a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%">configure</a>
and analyze the output as generated in the error.log file of your web server. Try to
examine the output as generated by (a) a normal access to the site versus (b) a =refresh= of the
LDAP cache. There should be sufficient information in the log files to get to know what
exactly happens during this imporant step.

Note that that ={Ldap}{Debug}= will _only_ switch on debug notes of
!LdapContrib, _not_ of your web server performing ldap requests on its own
depending on your setup.

Independent from !LdapContrib and Foswiki itself there is a small perl utility in =&lt;wiki-install-path>/tools/ldaptools=
that can be used to explore the records as returned by your LDAP server on various search requests.
This file is easy to understand and should be modified with a text editor before using it for the first
time to reflect the specific settings required to connect your LDAP server.
